# Arcady Menu
A blazor webapp for the 2023 menu at Arcady Hall.

The weekly menu was on a little piece of paper that was annoying to read. I made this website instead. The meals are entered into a database each week, and the website pulls data from there.

`DataService` handles communicatoin with the backend, the rest of the app is just UI stuff. The app is responsive and different UI elements are active on different sized screens.
